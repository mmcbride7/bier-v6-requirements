      <t>This scenario depicts that a BIER packet is replicated from a BFIR to
      BFERs across an IPv6 network. BIER header, which includes the BitString
      indicating a set of egress routers, is supposed to direct the packet
      from one BFR to the next BFRs, and IPv6 header is supposed to provide
      connectivity between BFRs. Different BIER IPv6 encapsulation models to
      arrange BIER header and IPv6 header together are defined in section 3;
      Other aspects that should be considered in BIER IPv6 solutions are
      defined in section 4. </t>
    </section>

    <section title="BIER IPv6 Encapsulation Models">
      <t>This section introduces two conceptual models for BIER IPv6
      encapsulation.</t>

      <section title="Transport-Independent Model">
        <t>In a Transport-Independent Model, IPv6 is used as tunnel between
        BFR and BIER is treated as an independent layer.</t>

        <t><figure align="left">

  ~~~~~~~ IPv6(P2P) tunnel
  
  <-----> BIER(P2MP) tunnel
      ]]></artwork>
          </figure></t>

        <t>In this model, an IPv6 tunnel works as a link-layer between BFR,
        and BIER works as a transport-independent layer over a virtual-link
        (IPv6 tunnel). On each BFR, the IPv6 tunnel is ended and IPv6 header
        of the receiving packet is decapsulated; while a new IPv6 tunnel is
        encapsulated before sending the packet to the next-hop BFR
        neighbour.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Native IPv6 Model">
        <t>In the Native IPv6 Model, BIER header is integreted as part of the
        IPv6 encapsulation as an extension header.</t>

        <t><figure align="left">
            <artwork><![CDATA[      
       |<----------(L3 BIER(P2MP) tunnel)--------->|

      ]]></artwork>
          </figure></t>

        <t>BFIR and BFERs work as IPv6 (P2MP) tunnel endpoints, and IPv6
        source address is the BIER packet source-origin identifier, which is
        unchanged through the BIER domain from BFIR to BFERs. BFRs work as
        IPv6 segment endpoints. On each BFR, BIER header is parsed as an
        endpoint of a segmenet and there is no decapsulation or encapsulation
        of new IPv6 tunnel.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Requirements">
      <t>This section defines other aspects that should be considered in BIER
      IPv6 solutions.</t>

      <t>Considering that the importance of each requirementr is different,
      the requirements are divided into two groups: mandatory and optional.
      The requirements in the mandatory group are considered necessary for any
      BIER IPv6 solution, while the requirements in the optional group should
      be considered but are not mandatory.</t>

      <section title="Mandatory Requirements">
        <section title="L2 Agnostic">
          <t>The solution must be agnostic to the underlying L2 data link
          type. </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Align to BIER architecture">
          <t>The solution must align to the BIER architecture defined in <xref
          target="RFC8279"/>.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Support deployment with Non-BFR routers">
          <t>The solution must support deployments with Non-BFR routers. This
          is beneficial to the deployment of BIER, especially in early
          deployments when some routers do not support BIER forwarding but
          support IPv6 forwarding. This is also the No.1 charter item,
          "Transition Mechanisms and Partial Deployments" of the BIER WG.</t>

          <t>One such case involves supporting a non-BFR router in a network
          as described in section 6.9 of RFC8279. In the context of this
          document, an IPv6 based unicast tunnel is needed to support such
          deployment where a non-BFR exists. Another case is to support
          inter-AS multicast deployment as illustrated in <xref
          target="I-D.geng-bier-ipv6-inter-domain"/>. In such deployment,
          there are non-BFR routers, or even an entire non-BIER network, that
          needs the ability to traverse from one BFR to another. <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-bier-use-cases"/> shows it is possible there are
          other cases where inter-AS multicast deployment is required.</t>

          <t>As with IPv6, another problem of BIER IPv6 technology may be
          "Transition Mechanisms and Partial Deployments" which is listed as
          the No.1 charter item of BIER WG. Therefore, a basic requirement of
          BIER IPv6 is to leverage IPv6 reachability for incremental and
          inter-AS BIER deployment.</t>

          <t>Below is a simple scenario that needs BIER IPv6 encapsulation and
          forwarding:</t>

          <t>This scenario depicts the need to replicate bier packets from a
          BFIR to BFERs across an IPv6 core. The IPv6 environment may include
          a variety of link types, may be entirely IPv6, may be dual stack or
          any type of combination which includes IPv6. Regardless of the
          environment, there are times when a BIER header, including the BIER
          BitString used to determine the set of BIER forwarding egress
          routers, will need to traverse a IPv6 domain. The ways in which BIER
          will function in an IPv6 environment is the problem that needs to be
          solved.</t>

          cases.</t>

        <section title="Support inter-AS multicast deployment">
          <t>Inter-AS multicast support is needed for ease of provisioning the
          P2MP transport service to enterprises. This could greatly increase
          the scalability of BIER, as it is usually considered to be suitable
          only for small intra-AS scenarios.</t>

        <section title="Support Native IPv6 Functions">
          <t>IPSEC is optional to IPv6 and multicast. It is preferred to
          support IPSEC, including AH/ESP. If IPSEC is to be supported, it
          shouldn't require hop-by-hop encryption/decryption.</t>

          <t>As part of IPv6 specification [RFC8200], BIER IPv6 may support
          fragmentation on BFIR and assembly on BFER. Support of Fragmentation
          can enhance the capability of BIER leveraging the BIER-MTU as
          introduced in section 3 of [RFC8296]. If Fragmentation is to be
          supported, it shouldn't require fragmentation and re-assembly at
          each hop.</t>

    <section title="Solutions Evaluation">
      <t>The following are solutions that have been proposed to solve BIER in
      IPv6 environments. Some solutions propose encoding while others propose
      encapsulation. It is recommended for the wg to evaluate these solutions
      against the requirements listed previously in order to make informed
      decisions on solution readiness.</t>

      <t>As illustrated in these examples, the BIER header, or the BitString,
      may appear in the IPv6 Header, IPv6 Extension Header, IPv6 Payload, or

        <t>BIER-ETH encapsulation (BIER header for Non-MPLS networks as

        multicast data in the IPv6 network by encapsulating the multicast user
        data payload within the BIER-ETH header. However, BIER-ETH in IPv6
        networks is not considered to be a "BIER natively in IPv6" solution
        which utilizes the IPv6 header to forward the packet.</t>

        <t>As described in <xref target="I-D.pfister-bier-over-ipv6"/>, The
        information required by BIER is stored in the destination IPv6
        address. The BIER BitString is encoded in the low-order bits of the
        IPv6 destination address of each packet. The high-order bits of the
        IPv6 destination address are used by intermediate routers for unicast
        forwarding, deciding whether a packet is a BIER packet, and if so, to
        identify the BIER Sub-Domain, Set Identifier and BitString length. No
        additional extension or encapsulation header is required. Instead of
        encapsulating the packet in IPv6, the payload is attached to the BIER
        IPv6 header and the IPv6 protocol number is set to the type of the
        payload. If the payload is UDP, the UDP checksum needs to change when
        the BitString in the IPv6 destination address changes.</t>

        <t>According to <xref target="RFC8200"/> In IPv6, optional
        internet-layer information is encoded in separate headers that may be
        placed between the IPv6 header and the upper- layer header in a
        packet. There is a small number of such extension headers, each one
        identified by a distinct Next Header value. An IPv6 packet may carry
        zero, one, or more extension headers, each identified by the Next
        Header field of the preceding header. Extension headers (except for
        the Hop-by-Hop Options header) are not processed, inserted, or deleted
        by any node along a packet's delivery path, until the packet reaches
        the node (or each of the set of nodes, in the case of multicast)
        identified in the Destination Address field of the IPv6 header. The
        Hop-by-Hop Options header is not inserted or deleted, but may be
        examined or processed by any node along a packet's delivery path,
        until the packet reaches the node (or each of the set of nodes, in the
        case of multicast) identified in the Destination Address field of the
        IPv6 header. The Hop-by-Hop Options header, when present, must
        immediately follow the IPv6 header. Its presence is indicated by the
        value zero in the Next Header field of the IPv6 header.</t>

        <t>Two of the currently-defined extension headers are the Hop-by-Hop
        Options header and the Destination Options header which carry a
        variable number of type-length-value (TLV) encoded "options".</t>

        <t/>

        <t>In <xref target="I-D.xie-bier-ipv6-encapsulation"/> an IPv6 BIER
        Destination Option is carried by the IPv6 Destination Option Header
        (indicated by a Next Header value 60). It is initialized in a packet
        sent by an IPv6 BFIR router to inform the following BFR routers in an
        IPv6 BIER domain to replicate to destination BFER routers hop-by-hop.
        BIER is generally a hop-by-hop and one-to-many architecture and it is
        required for a BIER IPv6 encapsulation to include the BIER Header
        ([RFC8296]) as an IPv6 Extension Header, to pilot the hop-by-hop BIER
        replication.</t>

        <t>Hop by hop Options Headers may be considered. The Hop-by-Hop
        Options header is used to carry optional information that may be
        examined and processed by every node along a packet's delivery path.
        The Hop-by-Hop Options header is identified by a Next Header value of
        0 in the IPv6 header.</t>

        <t>Defining New Extension Headers and Options may also be considered,
        if the IPv6 Destination Option Header is not good enough and new
        extension headers can solve the problem better.</t>

        <t>Such proposals may include requests to IANA to allocate a "BIER
        Option" code from "Destination Options and Hop-by-Hop Options", and/or
        a "BIER Option Header" code from "IPv6 Extension Header Types".</t>

        <t>There is a proposal for a transport-independent BIER encapsulation
        header which is applicable regardless of the underlying transport
        technology. As described in <xref target="I-D.xu-bier-encapsulation"/>
        and <xref target="I-D.zhang-bier-bierin6"/>, the BIER header, and the
        payload following it, can be combined as an IPv6 payload, and be
        indicated by a new Upper-layer IPv6 Next-Header value. A unicast IPv6
        destination address is used for the replication and changes when
        replicating a packet out to a neighbor.</t>

        <t>Such proposals may include a request to IANA to allocate an IPv6
        Next-Header code from "Assigned Internet Protocol Numbers".</t>

        <t>A generic IPv6 Tunnel could be used to encapsulate the bier packet
        within an IPv6 domain.</t>

        <t>GRE is a mechanism by which any ethernet payload can be carried by
        an IP GRE tunnel due to the 16-bits 'Protocol Type' field. Both IPv4
        and IPv6 can be used to carry GRE. The Ethernet type codepoint 0xAB37,
        defined for BIER, can be used in a GRE header to indicate the
        subsequent BIER header and payload in an IPv6 network.</t>

        <t>UDP-based tunnelling is another mechanism which uses a specific UDP
        port to indicate a UDP payload format. Both IPv4 and IPv6 can support
        UDP. Such UDP-based tunnels can be used for BIER in a IPv6 network by
        defining a new UDP port to indicate the BIER header and payload.</t>
